# Tarot
*Tarot* is an ancient card game and Cartomancy tool, likely invented in the 14th century. Some believe that 
the cards have inherent power, while others just believe they are a tool for the reader.

The cards of a Tarot deck describe the story of a person's life and the symbolic art serves as a catalyst for
conversations between the reader and the querent about their life. When used correctly, the cards can help the querent
learn about themselves and live a more conscientious life.

The random nature of drawing cards is also beneficial it allows the querent to escape their own perspective and
consider new ideas or points of view. Because of the random nature of card drawings, you may not always get
insightful draws, but when you do they can be quite helpful.

# Interpretation of Cards
Tarot cards do have a generally accepted meaning, but the interpretation of the cards is subjective. The major arcana
*Death* is generally accepted to mean an ending that may allow opportunity for something new, but its inherent meaning
is not useful without context. Meaning in Tarot is derived from the application of the meaning of the card to the life
of the querent to gain wisdom.

# Major and Minor Arcana
A standard 78-card Tarot deck is divided into two parts: the major and minor arcana. The major arcana represent
major aspects of one's journey through life such as desire, will, truth, and aspirations. The minor arcana are
likewise divided into these categories as cups (emotion, desire), pentacles (oneself, stability, aspirations),
swords (thoughts, beliefs, truth), and wands (goals, actions, ambitions). Each set of minor arcana represents
an element (water, earth, air, fire - cups, pentacles, swords, wands) and consists of 14 cards, each with an assigned
meaning based on their order. The ace represents the beginning of a cycle and the 10 represents its completion.

# Why Create a Commandline Program for Tarot?
I created a Tarot program because I believe it's important to live an examined life. Drawing a cardo or cards every 
morning (physically or digitally) gives me principle(s) to contemplate throughout the day.
